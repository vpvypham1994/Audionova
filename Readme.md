# AudioNova

## Introduction
AudioNova is a Windows-based text-to-speech and voice transformation application. It operates entirely on-device using models optimized through Qualcomm AI Hub for Snapdragon processors, ensuring enhanced performance, lower latency, and guaranteed data privacy. Users can generate natural-sounding voices from text, clone custom voices, and transform existing audio into any of the available or cloned voicesâ€”all without relying on cloud services.

## Prerequisite
1. **Python 3.11**  
   - Ensure you have Python 3.11 installed on your system.
2. **Node.js and npm**  
   - Required for installing and managing certain frontend or build dependencies.  
   - You can download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation
1. **Download/Clone the AudioNova repository** onto your Windows machine.
2. Open the project folder in your file explorer.
3. Create a checkpoints folder (./checkpoints/) in the installation directory. Manually download the vallex-checkpoint.pt file from here and put it in the checkpoints folder.
4. **Double-click** on the `run.bat` file to launch the application.  
   - This script handles initializing necessary services and launching the user interface.
